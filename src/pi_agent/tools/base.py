"""Tool definition.

A :class:`Tool` bundles everything the system needs about one capability:
its name, a description (shown to the model), a JSON-schema for its arguments,
the function that runs it, and whether it mutates state (so the UI can ask for
confirmation). Adding a new tool later is just creating one more ``Tool``.
